This is my project that I am submitting for the Udacity Full stack Web Development Nano Degree.

This is not intended to be used by anyone but if you want to use it feel free.

## How It Works

You simply add movies in the following format to entertainment_center.py:
```
variable_name = media.Movie(
  "Movie Title",
  "Movie Story Line",
  "Movie poster URL",
  "Movie Trailer URL"
)
```
And then add the vairable name to the movies list at the bottom of the page

Then when you run this file it will generate an html file called fresh_tomatoes.html, this can be used anywhere.

## Usage

First you need to install python 2.7

Then either clone this project to your local repository or download the zip.

Then in a command prompt or terminal window cd to the folder the files are located in and use
```
python entertainment_centre.py
```
This will generate fresh_tomatoes.html and open it in your defualt browser.
